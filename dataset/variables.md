Estimate gives the country's score on the aggregate indicator, in units of a standard normal distribution, i.e. ranging from approximately -2.5 to 2.5. The data refer to 2019

- **CPI**: The CPI 2019 is calculated using 13 different data sources from 12 different institutions that capture perceptions of corruption within the past two years. https://images.transparencycdn.org/images/2019_CPI_methodology.pdf through this link is it possible to find a description about the 13 data sources used.
Data sources have been standardized to a scale of 0-100 where a 0 equals the highest level of perceived corruption and 100 equals the lowest level of perceived corruption. This standardisation is done by subtracting the mean of each source in the baseline year from each country score and then dividing by the standard deviation of that source in the baseline year. This subtraction and division using the baseline year parameters ensures that the CPI scores are comparable year on year since 2012. After this procedure, the standardised scores are transformed to the CPI scale by multiplying with the value of the CPI standard deviation in 2012 (20) and adding the mean of CPI in 2012 (45), so that the data set fits the CPIâ€™s 0-100 scale.
